                    Code Red Robotics is Ithaca High School's local FRC team. 
                    The goal is to create a robot entirely from scratch in 6 weeks that competes in a competition in a predesigned game setting. 
                    I mostly worked on the programming and strategy subteam. 
                    For programming, I mostly worked on the indexer subsystem, which organizes the cargo that is taken in from acquisiton, and prepares it to be shot out of the launcher. 
                    This project gave me practice with command based programming, using github, and working with a team.

                    Chemicle is a variation of the popular word guessing game Wordle. In Wordle, players guess a word and they are told if the letters are contained in that word.
                    In Chemicle, players try to guess a valid ionic compound in only 6 lines. 
                    This project is coded entirely in java and gave me valuable practice with polymorphism and JTextComponents.
