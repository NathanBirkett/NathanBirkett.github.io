                                This is a tool to visualize lambda functions that I made for my submission <\a> into the 3rd Summer of Math Exposition.
                                It's currently extremely buggy, so be warned.
                                The goal was to improve the usual lambda notation which becomes very cumbersome with complex tasks like shown in the video.
                                This was written in plain javascript using the createJS library, so I gained lots of experience with using javascript.
                                This project also gave me a chance to create a plan for the structure from the beginning and then follow through.

                                Code Red Robotics is Ithaca High School's local FRC team. 
                                The goal is to create a robot entirely from scratch in 6 weeks that competes in a competition in a predesigned game setting. 
                                I mostly worked on the programming and strategy subteams. 
                                For programming, I mostly worked on the indexer subsystem, which organizes the cargo that is taken in from acquisiton, and prepares it to be shot out of the launcher. 
                                This project gave me practice with command based programming, using github, and working in a team.

                                For the 2023 season I was the progrogramming subteam head, meaning I had to organize a team of around a dozen people to program this robot effectively.
                                This year, we had to implement a swerve drive system, a double jointed arm with an elevator, and follow paths completely autonomously, all using closed loop control.
                                I learned a lot about robotics, computer science, and how to effectively lead a team in a fast paced environment.

                                KotLisn is a music player app for android developed in Kotlin.
                                This is the sucessor to the desktop app Plylist, and it has tons of improvements on UI, speed, and features.
                                The UI is material design, and there is much more flexibility in playlist creation and selection.
                                The randomization algorithm was updated to give an even selection of songs between all selected playlists.
                                This project taught me android design principles, the Kotlin language, and best practices for mobile apps.

                                Plylist is a music playing python program. You can add and edit playlists, combine them and play them.
                                But, what's special about this program is that when you start a playlist, it shuffles it so that if you listen to the whole playlist, each song will have played for the same total amount of time.
                                This gave me some experience with python, as it was my first major project with the language.
                                It also gave me experience with working with json files and file management.

                                Chemicle is a variation of the popular word guessing game Wordle. In Wordle, players guess a word and they are told if the letters are contained in that word.
                                In Chemicle, players try to guess a valid ionic compound in only 6 lines.
                                This project is coded entirely in java and gave me valuable practice with polymorphism and java swing.

                                This is similar to my Grapher program, but different. It uses the marching squares algorithm to generate the graph, which makes it much more accurate and more efficient.
                                It also means that it can draw any equation, not just linear or quadratic ones like Grapher.
                                But, this program can't do things like linear regression or points of intersection like Grapher.
                                This gave me experience with implementing algorithms, and using pygame.

                                Grapher is a graphing program made with java.
                                It can plot lines, parabolas, and points, and it can find the linear line of best fit, and intersections between 2 equations.
                                This project was one of my first projects with java, so most of it is spaghetti code, but it gave me lots of practice with user input and using math with programming.
